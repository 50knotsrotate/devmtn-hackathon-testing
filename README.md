## DevMountain Hackathon Testing Challenge 

Your goal is to write the functions in assessment.js to pass all the tests in assessment.test.js. The function layout is written out for you, and all the import/export has been done for you. All you have to focus on is writing the functionality for the code to work. 

**Make sure to yarn or npm install before starting the challenge**
